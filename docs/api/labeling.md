# Labeling & Diversity

[← Back to API index](../API.md)

> These endpoints read/mutate the active dataset and detector via the
> [`X-Dataset-Id` / `X-Detector-Id` context headers](../API.md#context-headers-x-dataset-id--x-detector-id).

## Inclusion & Thresholds

### Get / set inclusion

```
GET /api/inclusion
```

→ `{"inclusion": 0}`

```
POST /api/inclusion
```

**Body:** `{"inclusion": 3}`

Value is clamped to the range -10 to +10.

→ `{"inclusion": 3}`

## Labeling Progress

### Analyze progress

```
POST /api/labeling-progress
```

Requires at least one good vote, one bad vote, and label history.

→ Analysis object with progress metrics (structure depends on internal
implementation).

### Labeling status indicators

```
GET /api/labeling-status
```

→
```json
{
  "smart": {"status": "green"},
  "stable": {"status": "yellow"},
  "span": {"status": "red"}
}
```

Each metric has a `status` of `"red"`, `"yellow"`, or `"green"`.

> **Metric-id naming note.** The third indicator is keyed **`span`** in this
> `labeling-status` response, but the `metric` query/body parameter on
> `indicator-score-history` and `eval/train-and-score` (below) uses
> **`diverse`** for the same concept. Both spellings are intentional in the
> current code: use `span` when reading a status object, and `diverse` when
> requesting the diversity metric. (`smart` and `stable` are spelled the same
> in both places.)

### Indicator score history

```
GET /api/indicator-score-history
```

**Query params:** `metric`: one of `"smart"`, `"stable"`, `"diverse"`.

→ `{"metric": "smart", "history": [...], "complete": true}`

Returns per-step indicator data straight from the cache that the
`labeling-status` background worker advances. This route is **read-only**: it
never advances the cache and never trains a model, so it returns promptly
whatever the dataset size or label-history length.

`smart` carries one point per label step the app actually trained a detector
for — that is, per step whose label set a learned sort ran against. `stable`
carries one per such step after the first, since each entry compares a detector
against the one trained before it. Steps in between are absent from both, so the
series are shorter than the label history and their `num_labels` values are not
contiguous. `diverse` measures the votes rather than a detector and does have a
point per step.

A `complete: true` response with an empty `smart` history is therefore a real
answer, not a miss: it means nothing has been trained yet.

When the cache does not yet cover the whole label history — the normal state
while the user is actively labeling, since `labeling-status` defers the advance
to a background worker — the response is `{"metric": ..., "history": [],
"complete": false}`. Clients should then fall back to
`POST /api/eval/train-and-score` (below), which computes the same series on a
background thread with live progress and cancellation. `complete: false` is
also returned if the cache is momentarily locked by an in-flight refresh, so
the read never waits on a build.

### Evaluate metric (train-and-score)

```
POST /api/eval/train-and-score
```

**Body:** `{"metric": "smart"}` (or `"stable"` / `"diverse"`; optional `"wait": true`)

The work retrains the detector head at every step of the label history, so it runs
on a background daemon thread. The route returns immediately with a `job_id`;
poll `GET /api/eval/train-and-score/result` for the metric data and subscribe
to the `eval` SSE channel for live progress. A signature cache short-circuits
identical re-runs. Tests can pass `{"wait": true}` to block until done and get
the data inline.

→ `{"job_id": "...", "status": "running", "current": 0, "total": 10}`, or
(cached / `wait=true`) `{"job_id": "...", "status": "done", "metric": "smart",
"error_cost": [...]}`. The metric-specific key is `error_cost` (smart),
`stability` (stable), or `diversity` (diverse).

### Poll train-and-score result

```
GET /api/eval/train-and-score/result
```

**Query params:** `job_id`: the id returned by `train-and-score`.

→ `running`: `{"job_id": "...", "status": "running", "current": 5, "total": 10}`;
`done`: same shape as the cached/`wait` response above; `cancelled`:
`{"job_id": "...", "status": "cancelled"}`. 404 if the job is unknown; 500 if
the background job failed.

### Cancel train-and-score

```
POST /api/eval/train-and-score/cancel/{job_id}
```

Sets the cancel flag on the background job; the per-step retrain loop polls it
cooperatively. Returns 200 even when the job has already finished. 404 if the
job is unknown.

→ `{"ok": true}`

### Evaluation progress (SSE)

Eval progress streams on the `eval` channel of
[`/api/events`](events.md):

```json
{"status": "running", "message": "Computing smart...", "current": 5, "total": 10}
```

`status` is `"idle"` or `"running"`; the operation is done once `status`
is back to `"idle"` and `current >= total`.

## Coverage Atlas

### Get next diverse sample

```
GET /api/coverage-atlas/next
POST /api/coverage-atlas/next
```

POST accepts an optional body with sort scores to influence selection:

**Body:** `{"scores": {"0": 0.9, "1": 0.2}}`

→ `{"id": 42, "coverage_level": 3, "exhausted": false}`

`id` is `null` when the atlas is not built or exhausted. `coverage_level` is the
number of consecutive evidence-bearing nodes in BFS order (0 when nothing is
labeled, up to the total number of atlas nodes when fully covered). `exhausted`
is `true` when every node carries labeled evidence. Sibling nodes are visited
largest-first, so each suggestion covers the biggest unexplored region.

With scores, the pick is a surprise probe: a presumed-good node (median score
at or above the threshold) yields its lowest-scored element, a presumed-bad
node its highest-scored one. In nodes with a concentrated direction the
extremum is drawn from the node's typical half, so a flip signals a real
hidden pocket rather than a lone oddball.
